-- INSTALLATION --
Download the latest release version and extract the files from the archive file into any 
folder; the program can be started directly from that location. The settings.txt file
contains the path to the flag image folder (first line), and the name of the flag index 
text file (second line). The flag index file lists on each line a country name, its flag
image file name, and the country code, separated with tabs. You can use this format to
create custom collections of flags.


-- FEATURES --
Explorer: Select a country to view its flag.
Quiz: Click 'new question', match the correct country name to the flag displayed, click
'submit' to check answer.
